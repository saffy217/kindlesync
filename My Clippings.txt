She said things, they lit up gold in the air, and then they fell to nothing like so much cigarette ash. This wasn’t something that floated around inside her head and then out her mouth. This was something she had put away somewhere dark, where the light wouldn’t fade it, where no one could talk her out of

似曾相識, Judy thought. The sensation of having already met someone, or what the French called déjà vu, the feeling of having already seen something. There was probably a scientific explanation for it, but the older she got, the more she was inclined to give in to the feeling that these moments were glimpses into a world greater than this physical one. It was as if there were cycles that repeated themselves over and over, but most people never saw the repetition; they were too deeply enmeshed in their own path to see.

We can assert all this with some confidence because we still occasionally encounter islands of deep time today—in those moments when, to quote the writer Gary Eberle, we slip “into a realm where there is enough of everything, where we are not trying to fill a void in ourselves or the world.” The boundary separating the self from the rest of reality grows blurry, and time stands still. “The clock does not stop, of course,” Eberle writes, “but we do not hear it ticking.” This happens for some people in prayer, or in meditation, or in magnificent landscapes; I’m pretty sure my toddler son spent the whole of his infancy in such a state and is only now beginning to leave it. (Until we get them onto schedules, babies are the ultimate “task-oriented” beings, which, along with sleep deprivation, may explain the otherworldliness of those first few months with a newborn: you’re dragged from clock time into deep time, whether you like it or not.) The Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, visiting Kenya in 1925, was setting out on a hike in the first glow of dawn when he, too, was suddenly plunged into timelessness: From a low hill in this broad savanna, a magnificent prospect opened out to us. To the very brink of the horizon we saw gigantic herds of animals: gazelle, antelope, gnu, zebra, warthog, and so on. Grazing heads nodding, the herds moved forward like slow rivers. There was scarcely any sound save the melancholy cry of a bird of prey. This was the stillness of the eternal beginning, the world as it had always been, in the state

The fundamental problem is that this attitude toward time sets up a rigged game in which it’s impossible ever to feel as though you’re doing well enough. Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time—instead of just being time, you might say—it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally “out of the way.”

Our troubled relationship with time arises largely from this same effort to avoid the painful constraints of reality. And most of our strategies for becoming more productive make things worse, because they’re really just ways of furthering the avoidance. After all, it’s painful to confront how limited your time is, because it means that tough choices are inevitable and that you won’t have time for all you once dreamed you might do. It’s also painful to accept your limited control over the time you do get: maybe you simply lack the stamina or talent or other resources to perform well in all the roles you feel you should. And so, rather than face our limitations, we engage in avoidance strategies, in an effort to carry on feeling limitless.

After all, it’s painful to confront how limited your time is, because it means that tough choices are inevitable and that you won’t have time for all you once dreamed you might do. It’s also painful to accept your limited control over the time you do get: maybe you simply lack the stamina or talent or other resources to perform well in all the roles you feel you should. And so, rather than face our limitations, we engage in avoidance strategies, in an effort to carry on feeling limitless. We push ourselves harder, chasing fantasies of the perfect work-life balance; or we implement time management systems that promise to make time for everything, so that tough choices won’t be required. Or we procrastinate, which is another means of maintaining the feeling of omnipotent control over life—because you needn’t risk the upsetting experience of failing at an intimidating project, obviously, if you never even start it. We fill our minds with busyness and distraction to numb ourselves emotionally. (“We labour at our daily work more ardently and thoughtlessly than is necessary to sustain our life,” wrote Nietzsche, “because to us it is even more necessary not to have leisure to stop and think. Haste is universal because everyone is in flight from himself.”) Or we plan compulsively, because the alternative is to confront how little control over the future we really have. Moreover, most of us seek a specifically individualistic kind of mastery over time—our culture’s ideal is that you alone should control your schedule, doing whatever you prefer, whenever you want—because it’s scary to confront the truth that almost everything worth doing, from marriage and parenting to business or politics, depends on cooperating with others, and therefore on exposing yourself to the emotional uncertainties of relationships.

The more you hurry, the more frustrating it is to encounter tasks (or toddlers) that won’t be hurried; the more compulsively you plan for the future, the more anxious you feel about any remaining uncertainties, of which there will always be plenty. And the more individual sovereignty you achieve over your time, the lonelier you get. All of this illustrates what might be termed the paradox of limitation, which runs through everything that follows: the more you try to manage your time with the goal of achieving a feeling of total control, and freedom from the inevitable constraints of being human, the more stressful, empty, and frustrating life gets.

What are stories for? That question becomes even harder to answer when we consider that an astonishing proportion of what counts today as “Jewish” literature in English is basically Holocaust fiction. If the purpose of literature is to “uplift” us, is it even possible to write fiction that is honest about the most horrifying aspects of the Jewish past?

Fermaglich is careful to note that the vast majority of Jewish name-changers did not actually take on new non-Jewish identities; most continued contributing to Jewish organizations and participating in Jewish communal life. Fermaglich presents this point optimistically, as a grand refutation of the popular assumption that such people rejected their Jewish roots. But to me, this fact demonstrates just how profoundly oppressive the situation must have been, if even those who chose to participate in organized Jewish communities felt that a name change was necessary. These people were not “self-hating Jews.” They were simply staring down a reality that they could not deny. And as the wording of their petitions reveals, they also could not allow themselves to admit exactly what that reality was.

As minorities limited by sheer numbers in their ability to control the majority’s determination of their fate, all diaspora Jewish communities are fundamentally vulnerable. This unforgiving fact also applied to the American Jewish community at the time when 2 million Jews arrived through Ellis Island, and perhaps even more so, to the American Jewish community at the time when those 2 million people’s children became adults. Surviving and thriving in this reality required far more than bravery and resilience. It demanded creativity, imagination, and above all, an utterly irrational faith in the fantasy of acceptance. Believing in a fantasy takes conscious effort. It requires convincing oneself of the absolute necessity of believing, and then never relenting, ever.

American Jews created for their descendants. We were told that our ancestors were definitely not humiliated people facing the reality of American antisemitism, even though that is demonstrated by thousands of court records. No, our ancestors were brave and hopeful people whom America joyously welcomed through that golden door. The lethal attacks on American Jews in recent years have been so shocking and disorienting not merely because of their sheer violent horror, but because they contradict the story American Jews have told themselves for generations, which is that America has never been a place where antisemitism affected anyone’s life. We don’t simply prefer this founding legend. We need it. The story is more important than the history, because the story is the device that makes meaning.

It occurs to me that Jewish tradition, like every tradition, is designed to protect against oblivion, capturing ancient experiences in ritual and story and passing them between generations—and that Diarna is simply a higher-tech version of what everyone’s ancestors once did, passing along memories around a fire, technology expanding that warm, bright circle around the fire to the world at large. I zoom in, listen, as if leaning toward the warmth, the light. And then, as I click idly from one Diarna file to another, an invisible curtain rises.

Because of Diarna, I see my own American landscape differently. I pass by the tiny eighteenth-century cemetery near my home with its Revolutionary War graves, and I think of the histories that might lie unseen alongside the ones we enshrine, wondering whether there might be a Native American burial ground under the local Walgreens, whether I am treading on someone else’s ancient sacred space. I know that I must be. We are always walking on the dead.

But as I read the endless wall texts describing the specific quantities of poison used to murder 90 percent of Europe’s Jewish children, something else occurred to me. Perhaps presenting all these facts has the opposite effect from what we think. Perhaps we are giving people ideas. I don’t mean giving people ideas about how to murder Jews. There is no shortage of ideas like that, going back to Pharaoh’s decree in the Book of Exodus about drowning Hebrew baby boys in the Nile. I mean, rather, that perhaps we are giving people ideas about our standards. Yes, everyone must learn about the Holocaust so as not to repeat it. But this has come to mean that anything short of the Holocaust is, well, not the Holocaust. The bar is rather high.

At the end of the show, on-screen survivors talk in a loop about how people need to love one another. While listening to this, it occurs to me that I have never read survivor literature in Yiddish—the language spoken by 80 percent of victims—suggesting this idea. In Yiddish, speaking only to other Jews, survivors talk about their murdered families, about their destroyed centuries-old communities, about Jewish national independence, about Jewish history, about self-defense, and on rare occasions, about vengeance. Love rarely comes up; why would it? But it comes up here, in this for-profit exhibition. Here it is the ultimate message, the final solution.

In his lectures to young communists in Germany during the rise of Hitler and the Nazis, psychologist Wilhelm Reich theorized that the suppression of sexuality was essential to an authoritarian government. Without the imposition of antisexual morality, he believed, people would be free from shame and would trust their own sense of right and wrong. They would be unlikely to march to war against their wishes or to operate death camps.

You’ve probably been taught to reserve the language of love for when you’re feeling overwhelmingly tender and passionate and only for those who have made huge commitments to you. Maybe you’ve been taught that using the “L-word” implies that you are making some large commitments. Wouldn’t it be better to ask ourselves how we love any particular person rather than worrying about whether we do or not?

Think of a moment of perfect wholeness, of yourself in perfect unity, of expanded awareness that transcends the split between mind and body and integrates all the parts of you in ecstatic consciousness….When you bring spiritual awareness to your sexual practice, you can become directly conscious of—connected to—that divinity that always flows through you….For us, sex is already an opportunity to see God.”

Listen to your fears: they have a lot to teach you about yourself. Not knowing what’s what can feel scary—but think of it as a chance to scrap all your preconceptions and start from scratch. It’s only by recognizing all the possibilities out there that you can choose the ones that work for you. Then you can be free to figure out where you want the boundaries in your life, what your personal limits are, and whether you ever want to expand those limits. Accomplishing this amazing task will set you free to explore beyond your wildest dreams.

Clean love is love without expectations. Washing your love clean doesn’t require advanced spirituality or weekly psychoanalysis. You’ll probably never let go of every single attachment—at least we’ve never managed it. But maybe you can let go just for an instant: your history, worries, frets, and yearnings will still be there to come back to when you need them. Just for now, take a look at the wonderful person who is standing right in front of you.

People new to polyamory tend to spend a lot of energy defining their boundaries. They usually focus more at first on what they don’t want their partner to do—the activities that make them feel, for some reason, unsafe or downright terrified—than on their actual desires. Setting these limits is, for many people, a necessary first step into the disorienting world of sluthood. However, as partnerships become more sophisticated at operating the boundaries of their relationship, they tend to focus more on what they would enjoy and then strategize about how they can make it safe.

Many polyfolk like to use a hierarchical terminology to define their relationships: the people they live with in a marriage-like arrangement are primaries, the people they love but don’t live with are secondaries, the people they enjoy spending (often sexual) time with, perhaps not as often or with less commitment, are tertiaries. Other language used for couplings are life partner and the rather sweet nesting partner.

Soon after—or concurrently; timeline-wise, there’s some overlap—Justin Bieber happened. Bieber is widely regarded as the original internet superstar. Someone like Miley Cyrus was already extremely famous because of her successful TV show and music career. But Bieber’s rise to fame began on the internet, and continues to thrive in the physical realm. Bieber is the type of public figure we now regard as an influencer; he formed an organic, grassroots connection between himself and his fans. He’s the type of star that fans feel ownership over because they played a part in his creation and elevation. Justin Bieber, who famously went from a Canadian kid busking on the streets of his hometown, to a YouTube star whose cover-song videos went viral, to an international icon, was not a celebrity first. He was just like us. We made him into a celebrity. We gave him the “gift” of fame. The reason we still pay attention to what people like Justin Bieber or Miley Cyrus are doing today is that we felt personally invested in and connected to their lives, and like a childhood friend you can’t stop stalking on social media (“Oh shit, Kelsey’s pregnant AGAIN? Why are racists so fertile??”), they hold a grip on our youthful selves that we can’t wriggle out of.

One thing that became pretty clear to me was that lesbianism was for men. That’s right, lesbians are for men. It would be weird for a girl to enjoy lesbianism, that thing that happens between two girls, because if a girl liked the lesbian thing happening in front of her, then one could speculate that she too was a lesbian. But if a man saw a lesbian thing happening in front of him and liked it, that would just mean that he’s a big, manly straight guy. (This is not to be confused with: if a man saw a lesbian thing happening in front of him and didn’t like it, then he himself was gay. Please keep up.)

Coming out as gay opened me up to a whole new realm of possibility, of people and art and movements to admire; I fell in love with femininity. Sure, I fell in love with actual women, like, the people. But coming out frees you in ways that I’m not sure any straight person ever fully experiences. Queer shame spans a spectrum. On the more dangerous and depraved side, you might place having a violently homophobic father, being beaten for queerness, being thrown out of your home, and being killed. On the other side of the spectrum, though one may not be actively in fear for their life on a daily basis, there’s still this undercurrent of shame, this feeling of “I shouldn’t be doing this,” where holding hands with your partner on the street might draw stares, judgment, a vocal outburst. Being able to overcome all of this, this anxiety that ranges from learning to protect yourself to justified paranoia, no matter where you fall on the spectrum, is nothing short of a miracle. And by “overcome,” I don’t mean holistically overcoming it—no, internalized homophobia will haunt you like Ari Gold eternally haunts Lloyd—but “overcome” as in saying it out loud, lifting that weight, that burden off yourself, of your own volition. Coming to a place of peace with yourself enough to say, “The world has historically said I should not be this, yet here I am, this, and I’m great,” is simply a mammoth feat of human strength. So when I came to reconcile myself with queerness, and found peace with it, I felt lighter in many other ways, ways that opened me up to new experiences, new interests, newfound appreciations. I decided I didn’t just love women, the people, in a romantic and sexual sense, but I loved women, the concept, everything we represent in the world, our drive, our persistence, our community, and yes, the hobbies and clothes and principles we’ve come together and agreed to love and participate in. For the first time since, I don’t know, probably since I was a five-year-old kid with a Yankees hat and all five Spice Girls dolls, I came to understand that being more or less feminine didn’t make me more or less valuable. Or better yet, that being a woman—and being a woman who loves women—is more valuable to me. Plus, what do men like that’s so “cool” anyway? True Detective? Mark Wahlberg? Cigars? Cigars are bad—I’ve had one before and either it didn’t work or it was bad. The point is: if an activity or a show or a thing is only (or mostly) adored by men, that’s a red flag.

And with the last of his courage, Linus Baker said, “Here. With you. If you’ll have me. Ask me again. Please, I beg you. Ask me to stay again.” Arthur nodded tightly. He cleared his throat. He was hoarse when he said, “Linus.” “Yes, Arthur?” “Stay. Here. With us. With me.” Linus could barely breathe. “Yes. Always. Yes. For them. For you. For—” He was being kissed. He hadn’t even seen Arthur move. One moment, he thought he was about to break, and the next, his face was cupped in warm hands, and lips were pressed against his own. He felt as if he were on fire, burning from the inside out. He reached up, putting his hands atop Arthur’s, holding them in place. He never wanted this moment to end. For all the love songs he’d ever listened to in his life, he hadn’t been prepared for how a moment like this could feel. Arthur pulled away, and began to laugh as Linus frantically kissed his chin and cheeks, his nose and forehead. Arthur dropped his hands and wrapped his arms around Linus, holding him close. Linus could hear the children cheering in the house as they began to sway in the light from a setting sun. “I’m sorry,” Linus whispered into Arthur’s throat, never wanting this moment to end. Arthur held him tighter. “You silly, delightful man. There is nothing to be sorry for. You fought for us. I could never be angry with you for that. How I cherish you.” Linus felt his heart settle in his chest. As they continued to sway to a song only they could hear, the sun finally sank below the horizon, and all was right in this tiny little corner of the world. Don’t you wish you were here?

So, technically, it’s irrational to feel troubled by an overwhelming to-do list. You’ll do what you can, you won’t do what you can’t, and the tyrannical inner voice insisting that you must do everything is simply mistaken. We rarely stop to consider things so rationally, though, because that would mean confronting the painful truth of our limitations. We would be forced to acknowledge that there are hard choices to be made: which balls to let drop, which people to disappoint, which cherished ambitions to abandon, which roles to fail at.

In his translator’s introduction to Rosa’s book Social Acceleration, Jonathan Trejo-Mathys writes: The more we can accelerate our ability to go to different places, see new things, try new foods, embrace various forms of spirituality, learn new activities, share sensual pleasures with others whether it be in dancing or sex, experience different forms of art, and so on, the less incongruence there is between the possibilities of experience we can realize in our own lifetimes and the total array of possibilities available to human beings now and in the future—that is, the closer we come to having a truly “fulfilled” life, in the literal sense of one that is as filled full of experiences as it can possibly be.

This helps explain why stuffing your life with pleasurable activities so often proves less satisfying than you’d expect. It’s an attempt to devour the experiences the world has to offer, to feel like you’ve truly lived—but the world has an effectively infinite number of experiences to offer, so getting a handful of them under your belt brings you no closer to a sense of having feasted on life’s possibilities. Instead, you find yourself pitched straight back into the efficiency trap. The more wonderful experiences you succeed in having, the more additional wonderful experiences you start to feel you could have, or ought to have, on top of all those you’ve already had, with the result that the feeling of existential overwhelm gets worse.

Whenever you encounter some potential new item for your to-do list or your social calendar, you’ll be strongly biased in favor of accepting it, because you’ll assume you needn’t sacrifice any other tasks or opportunities in order to make space for it. Yet because in reality your time is finite, doing anything requires sacrifice—the sacrifice of all the other things you could have been doing with that stretch of time. If you never stop to ask yourself if the sacrifice is worth it, your days will automatically begin to fill not just with more things, but with more trivial or tedious things, because they’ve never had to clear the hurdle of being judged more important than something else. Commonly, these will be things that other people want you to do, to make their lives easier, and which you didn’t think to try to resist. The more efficient you get, the more you become “a limitless reservoir for other people’s expectations,” in the words of the management expert Jim Benson.

What’s needed instead in such situations, I gradually came to understand, is a kind of anti-skill: not the counterproductive strategy of trying to make yourself more efficient, but rather a willingness to resist such urges—to learn to stay with the anxiety of feeling overwhelmed, of not being on top of everything, without automatically responding by trying to fit more in. To approach your days in this fashion means, instead of clearing the decks, declining to clear the decks, focusing instead on what’s truly of greatest consequence while tolerating the discomfort of knowing that, as you do so, the decks will be filling up further, with emails and errands and other to-dos, many of which you may never get around to at all. You’ll sometimes still decide to drive yourself hard in an effort to squeeze more in, when circumstances absolutely require it. But that won’t be your default mode, because you’ll no longer be operating under the illusion of one day making time for everything.

The same goes for existential overwhelm: what’s required is the will to resist the urge to consume more and more experiences, since that strategy can only lead to the feeling of having even more experiences left to consume. Once you truly understand that you’re guaranteed to miss out on almost every experience the world has to offer, the fact that there are so many you still haven’t experienced stops feeling like a problem. Instead, you get to focus on fully enjoying the tiny slice of experiences you actually do have time for—and the freer you are to choose, in each moment, what counts the most.

Frequently, the effect of convenience isn’t just that a given activity starts to feel less valuable, but that we stop engaging in certain valuable activities altogether, in favor of more convenient ones. Because you can stay home, order food on Seamless, and watch sitcoms on Netflix, you find yourself doing so—though you might be perfectly well aware that you’d have had a better time had you kept your appointment to meet friends in the city or tried to make an interesting new recipe.

In this situation, any decision I make, to do anything at all with my time, is already radically limited. For one thing, it’s limited in a retrospective sense, because I’m already who I am and where I am, which determines what possibilities are open to me. But it’s also radically limited in a forward-looking sense, too, not least because a decision to do any given thing will automatically mean sacrificing an infinite number of potential alternative paths. As I make hundreds of small choices throughout the day, I’m building a life—but at one and the same time, I’m closing off the possibility of countless others, forever. (The original Latin word for “decide,” decidere, means “to cut off,” as in slicing away alternatives; it’s a close cousin of words like “homicide” and “suicide.”) Any finite life—even the best one you could possibly imagine—is therefore a matter of ceaselessly waving goodbye to possibility. The only real question about all this finitude is whether we’re willing to confront it or not. And this, for Heidegger, is the central challenge of human existence: since finitude defines our lives, he argues that living a truly authentic life—becoming fully human—means facing up to that fact. We must live out our lives, to whatever extent we can, in clear-eyed acknowledgment of our limitations, in the undeluded mode of existence that Heidegger calls “Being-towards-death,” aware that this is it, that life is not a dress rehearsal, that every choice requires myriad sacrifices, and that time is always already running out—indeed, that it may run out today, tomorrow, or next month. And so it’s not merely a matter of spending each day “as if” it were your last, as the cliché has it. The point is that it always actually might be. I can’t entirely depend upon a single moment of the future.

Rather than taking ownership of our lives, we seek out distractions, or lose ourselves in busyness and the daily grind, so as to try to forget our real predicament. Or we try to avoid the intimidating responsibility of having to decide what to do with our finite time by telling ourselves that we don’t get to choose at all—that we must get married, or remain in a soul-destroying job, or anything else, simply because it’s the done thing. Or, as we saw in the previous chapter, we embark on the futile attempt to “get everything done,” which is really another way of trying to evade the responsibility of deciding what to do with your finite time—because if you actually could get everything done, you’d never have to choose among mutually exclusive possibilities. Life is usually more comfortable when you spend it avoiding the truth in this fashion. But it’s a stultifying, deadly sort of comfort. It’s only by facing our finitude that we can step into a truly authentic relationship with life.

I’m embarrassed to admit what an outsize negative effect such minor frustrations have had on my happiness over the years. Fairly often, they still do; but the effect was worst at the height of my productivity geekhood, because when you’re trying to Master Your Time, few things are more infuriating than a task or delay that’s foisted upon you against your will, with no regard for the schedule you’ve painstakingly drawn up in your overpriced notebook. But when you turn your attention instead to the fact that you’re in a position to have an irritating experience in the first place, matters are liable to look very different indeed. All at once, it can seem amazing to be there at all, having any experience, in a way that’s overwhelmingly more important than the fact that the experience happens to be an annoying one.

But if it’s amazing to have been granted any being at all—if “your whole life is borrowed time,” as Cain realized, watching news reports of the Danforth Avenue shootings—then wouldn’t it make more sense to speak not of having to make such choices, but of getting to make them? From this viewpoint, the situation starts to seem much less regrettable: each moment of decision becomes an opportunity to select from an enticing menu of possibilities, when you might easily never have been presented with the menu to begin with. And it stops making sense to pity yourself for having been cheated of all the other options.

In this situation, making a choice—picking one item from the menu—far from representing some kind of defeat, becomes an affirmation. It’s a positive commitment to spend a given portion of time doing this instead of that—actually, instead of an infinite number of other “thats”—because this, you’ve decided, is what counts the most right now. In other words, it’s precisely the fact that I could have chosen a different and perhaps equally valuable way to spend this afternoon that bestows meaning on the choice I did make. And the same applies, of course, to an entire lifetime. For instance, it’s precisely the fact that getting married forecloses the possibility of meeting someone else—someone who might genuinely have been a better marriage partner; who could ever say?—that makes marriage meaningful. The exhilaration that sometimes arises when you grasp this truth about finitude has been called the “joy of missing out,” by way of a deliberate contrast with the idea of the “fear of missing out.” It is the thrilling recognition that you wouldn’t even really want to be able to do everything, since if you didn’t have to decide what to miss out on, your choices couldn’t truly mean anything. In this state of mind, you can embrace the fact that you’re forgoing certain pleasures, or neglecting certain obligations, because whatever you’ve decided to do instead—earn money to support your family, write your novel, bathe the toddler, pause on a hiking trail to watch a pale winter sun sink below the horizon at dusk—is how you’ve chosen to spend a portion of time that you never had any right to expect.

This is the same insight embodied in two venerable pieces of time management advice: to work on your most important project for the first hour of each day, and to protect your time by scheduling “meetings” with yourself, marking them in your calendar so that other commitments can’t intrude. Thinking in terms of “paying yourself first” transforms these one-off tips into a philosophy of life, at the core of which lies this simple insight: if you plan to spend some of your four thousand weeks doing what matters most to you, then at some point you’re just going to have to start doing it. The second principle is to limit your work in progress. Perhaps the most appealing way to resist the truth about your finite time is to initiate a large number of projects at once; that way, you get to feel as though you’re keeping plenty of irons in the fire and making progress on all fronts. Instead, what usually ends up happening is that you make progress on no fronts—because each time a project starts to feel difficult, or frightening, or boring, you can bounce off to a different one instead. You get to preserve your sense of being in control of things, but at the cost of never finishing anything important.

The alternative approach is to fix a hard upper limit on the number of things that you allow yourself to work on at any given time. In their book Personal Kanban, which explores this strategy in detail, the management experts Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria Barry suggest no more than three items. Once you’ve selected those tasks, all other incoming demands on your time must wait until one of the three items has been completed, thereby freeing up a slot. (It’s also permissible to free up a slot by abandoning a project altogether if it isn’t working out. The point isn’t to force yourself to finish absolutely everything you start, but rather to banish the bad habit of keeping an ever-proliferating number of half-finished projects on the back burner.)

Everyone seems to agree that if you embark on a relationship when you secretly suspect you could find someone better, you’re guilty of settling, because you’re opting to use up a portion of your life with a less-than-ideal partner. But since time is finite, the decision to refuse to settle—to spend a decade restlessly scouring online dating networks for the perfect person—is also a case of settling, because you’re opting to use up a decade of your limited time in a different sort of less-than-ideal situation. Moreover, Goodin observes, we tend to contrast a life of settling with a life of what he labels “striving,” or living life to the fullest. But this is a mistake, too, and not just because settling is unavoidable but also because living life to the fullest requires settling. “You must settle, in a relatively enduring way, upon something that will be the object of your striving, in order for that striving to count as striving,” he writes: you can’t become an ultrasuccessful lawyer or artist or politician without first “settling” on law, or art, or politics, and therefore deciding to forgo the potential rewards of other careers. If you flit between them all, you’ll succeed in none of them. Likewise, there’s no possibility of a romantic relationship being truly fulfilling unless you’re willing, at least for a while, to settle for that specific relationship, with all its imperfections—which means spurning the seductive lure of an infinite number of superior imaginary alternatives.

dreaming of a partner who’s both six and five feet tall. And not only should you settle; ideally, you should settle in a way that makes it harder to back out, such as moving in together, or getting married, or having a child. The great irony of all our efforts to avoid facing finitude—to carry on believing that it might be possible not to have to choose between mutually exclusive options—is that when people finally do choose, in a relatively irreversible way, they’re usually much happier as a result. We’ll do almost anything to avoid burning our bridges, to keep alive the fantasy of a future unconstrained by limitation, yet having burned them, we’re generally pleased that we did so. Once, in an experiment, the Harvard University social psychologist Daniel Gilbert and a colleague gave hundreds of people the opportunity to pick a free poster from a selection of art prints. Then he divided the participants into two groups. The first group was told that they had a month in which they could exchange their poster for any other one; the second group was told that the decision they’d already made had been final. In follow-up surveys, it was the latter group—those who were stuck with their decision, and who thus weren’t distracted by the thought that it might still be possible to make a better choice—who showed by far the greater appreciation for the work of art they’d selected.

When you aim for this degree of control over your attention, you’re making the mistake of addressing one truth about human limitation—your limited time, and the consequent need to use it well—by denying another truth about human limitation, which is that achieving total sovereignty over your attention is almost certainly impossible. In any case, it would be highly undesirable to be able to do exactly as you wished with your attention. If outside forces couldn’t commandeer at least some of it against your will, you’d be unable to step out of the path of oncoming buses, or hear that your baby was in distress. Nor are the benefits confined to emergencies; the same phenomenon is what allows your attention to be seized by a beautiful sunset, or your eye to be caught by a stranger’s across a room. But it’s the obvious survival advantages of this kind of distractibility that explain why we evolved that way. The Paleolithic hunter-gatherer whose attention was alerted by a rustling in the bushes, whether he liked it or not, would have been far more likely to flourish than one who heard such rustlings only after first making the conscious decision to listen out for them.

After all, to have any meaningful experience, you must be able to focus on it, at least a bit. Otherwise, are you really having it at all? Can you have an experience you don’t experience? The finest meal at a Michelin-starred restaurant might as well be a plate of instant noodles if your mind is elsewhere; and a friendship to which you never actually give a moment’s thought is a friendship in name only. “Attention is the beginning of devotion,” writes the poet Mary Oliver, pointing to the fact that distraction and care are incompatible with each other: you can’t truly love a partner or a child, dedicate yourself to a career or to a cause—or just savor the pleasure of a stroll in the park—except to the extent that you can hold your attention on the object of your devotion to begin with.

For securely attached people, “dependency” is not a dirty word, but a fact of life that can be experienced without losing or compromising the self. Conversely, securely functioning adults are also comfortable with their independence and personal autonomy. They may miss their partners when they’re not together, but inside they feel fundamentally alright with themselves when they’re alone. They also feel minimal fear of abandonment when temporarily separated from their partner. In other words, securely attached people experience relational object constancy, which is the ability to trust in and maintain an emotional bond with people even during physical or emotional separation.

Children who experienced an insecure attachment environment, regardless of which style they adopted, can internalize the beliefs that to some degree the world is unsafe and people cannot truly be relied on. These children will also struggle with having a sturdy relational object constancy. Since relational object constancy is the ability to trust that your connection and bond with someone will persist beyond an initial separation or conflict, as an adult, having a compromised relational object constancy can make it extremely difficult to get through the disappointments, uncertainties, healthy conflicts, and natural ebbs and flows that adult romantic relationships inevitably produce.

In my therapy practice, I often notice that people who are relating from the dismissive style initially describe their parents or current romantic relationships as being great, even ideal, but just a few minutes of deeper questioning into their actual childhood experiences or current relational patterns reveals that things aren’t actually so perfect. This occurs because the deactivation of their attachment system has made it difficult for them to access and consistently stay in touch with their true feelings. For many, contacting and admitting one’s actual feelings might be perceived as a threat to their current relationship or to the status quo of their family of origin.

Parents who are loving but inconsistent can encourage the adaptation of the anxious style. Sometimes the parent is here and available, attuned and responsive, but then other times they are emotionally unavailable, mis-attuned or even intrusive, leaving the child confused and uncertain as to whether their parent is going to comfort them, ignore them, reward them or punish them for the very same behavior.

Even though people with this style tend to sacrifice themselves for the relationship, the ways in which they are preoccupied and compulsively give care are not necessarily attuned.

Someone with a preoccupied style has more awareness of both their feelings and their partner’s feelings, but they still struggle with differentiating and communicating their feelings and with managing their emotional responses in healthy ways. Also, although they’re aware of their partner’s feelings, they’re not necessarily reading those feelings accurately. People with this attachment style might be very precise in detecting even the slightest change in their partner’s mood or state, but they’re more likely to assume that the shifts are personal to them and that they are negative, when neither may be true.

Well-intentioned parents who push their child into more and more enriching activities can cause children to feel destabilized from the lack of rest, downtime and free play time that is needed to feel settled and soothed in the nervous system. In such cases, attachment figures may not be engaging in direct mistreatment of their child, but the surrounding environment or some of the parents’ behaviors can create fear and chaos for the child, disrupting their ability to feel safe and secure.

In the book Loving Bravely, Alexandra H. Solomon defines healthy boundaries as the balancing point where you are able to both connect to another as well as be separate from another, maintaining your own energy and sense of self while your partner maintains the energy that is theirs. Similar to how we need both autonomy and connection to be in secure functioning, we need to have connection and protection in concert with each other to maintain healthy boundaries. Our boundaries begin to become unhealthy when we’re either underprotected or overprotected towards others, as well as when we’re being too connected or not connected enough. Solomon further describes boundaries as either being too porous or too rigid in terms of what we allow in from others and how we give outwardly to others. Porous boundaries arise when we are connected but not protected, and rigid boundaries stem from being protected, but not connected.

When we rely on the structure of our relationship, whether that is through being monogamous with someone or practicing hierarchical forms of CNM, we run the risk of forgetting that secure attachment is an embodied expression built upon how we consistently respond and attune to each other, not something that gets created through structure and hierarchy. Secure attachment is created through the quality of experience we have with our partners, not through the notion or the fact of either being married or being a primary partner.

We often assume that having more structural ties in a relationship means more security.

The takeaway message here is not to abolish all relationship hierarchies or shared bank accounts, but instead for people to procure secure attachment from their relational experiences instead of their relationship structures. Allow your direct experience with a partner to be the vehicle to secure attachment instead of having certain relationship concepts, narratives or structures be the vehicle. When our experience with a partner is the route to secure attachment, we might still want certain relationship structures, benchmarks and milestone experiences, but the urgency at which we define, solidify or need to nail things down can relax and occur more organically. Current research and resources about attachment and consensual nonmonogamy are scarce and at an embryonic stage.

CNM, it is not necessary for all of our relationships to be attachment-based. There is a difference between being in a secure connection with someone and having a securely attached relationship. Secure connections are with people or partners who we don’t have daily or regular contact with, but with whom we know that when we reach out it will feel as if a moment hasn’t passed. We are secure in the bond that we have with such people, and this bond might be immensely meaningful, special and important to us, but it’s not necessarily a relationship that requires us to invest regular maintenance and attention. In CNM, these might be the partners we refer to as comets, satellites or casual. They’re the people who we see at special events a few times a year or our less-involved long-distance relationships. Securely attached relationships are based on consistency and reliability. These are the people who are there for each other in responsive and attuned ways more times than not. They are our “go-to” people who have our back and to whom we can turn when we feel hurt or threatened and or need support, comfort or reassurance. They’re the people we are excited to share our latest news or discoveries with.

is commonly and playfully known in the nonmonogamous world that you shouldn’t enter CNM unless you are ready to process, communicate, grow and then process, communicate and grow some more. This is because having multiple partners will expose all of your relationship baggage, your blind spots, shadows and shortcomings, and all the potential ways you’ve been asleep to social issues. Because of this, I’ve seen how nonmonogamy can actually become an accelerated path to growth, specifically when it comes to attachment, where it offers a path to healing that many people would not experience otherwise. When people are able to heal their previous attachment wounds, address any attachment changes that have occurred since opening up and create relationships that are founded on relational security instead of structural security, what previously felt impossible about CNM becomes possible, even celebratory.

The bedrock of being polysecure in our relationships is feeling that we have a safe haven to turn to. This happens when our partners care about our safety, seek to respond to our distress, help us to co-regulate and soothe and are a source of emotional and physical support and comfort. Similarly, when our partners are struggling or in need, we can be a safe haven by being there for them in warm, caring and receptive ways. When we can’t physically be there

In search of relationship safety, our attachment system is primed to seek the answers to certain questions regarding our partners. Both consciously and unconsciously we are looking to know: If I turn towards you, will you be there for me? Will you receive and accept me instead of attack, criticize, dismiss or judge me? Will you comfort me? Will you respond in a way that calms my nervous system? Do I matter to you? Do I make a difference in your life? Can we lean into and rely on each other? Interestingly,

When safety is established with our attachment figures and we have an internalized felt sense that we can turn towards them and lean on them when needed, we are freed up to securely turn away from them and engage in the world, whether with them by our side or on our own. A secure base provides the platform from which we can move out in the larger world, explore and take risks. This exploration facilitates our sense of personal competence and healthy autonomy. Similar to how children want to show their parents their latest drawings, tricks, accomplishments or discoveries, as adults we need to share the new things we’ve learned, the things we’ve achieved and the things we’re excited about. Being and having a secure base in our partnerships means supporting each other’s personal growth and exploration, independent activities and other relationships, even when these actions require time apart from each other. Secure base partners will not only support our explorations, but will also offer guidance when solicited and lovingly call us on our shit. They function as a compassionate mirror for our blind spots and all the ways we may be fooling ourselves, whether through self-aggrandizement or self-limitation.

When we can’t be available to our partners, the next best thing for both of our attachment systems is to tell them when we will be out of reach and when we will be back. If you can’t be immediately available to one of your partners, the next best thing you can do is let them know when you can, so that they know what to expect.

As adults, expressed delight is also needed to promote secure attachment and a healthy sense of self within the relationship. When our partners are able to articulate the ways that we are special and valuable to them, our interpersonal self-worth is supported. When we express the ways that we appreciate and are grateful for our partners, we create a culture of positivity in our relationships that allows mutual vulnerability, authenticity and joy to flourish. We can express the delight we have for our partners through our words, our actions, our touch, as well as just the look in our eyes. Diane Poole Heller and her colleagues use the term beam gleam (also known as the attachment gaze) to refer to the nonverbal expression of warmth, kindness and love that radiates from our eyes, letting our partners know that they are special to us. In nonmonogamy, expressed delight is imperative. The paradigm shift from the monogamous mindset of I am with you because you are the only one for me to the nonmonogamous view that I am with you because you are special and unique, but not the only one, can be difficult to grasp. Even when people don’t want to be, the hangover of monogamous thinking often leaves people feeling competitive with their metamours and/or doubtful as to why their partners would want to be with them if they don’t have the specific qualities, circumstances, sexual interests or physical attributes that other partners have. Even when people have a healthy sense of self and esteem, they still need positive feedback as to why their partners cherish them and choose to be with them, especially when, theoretically, they can choose to be with many others.

The art is greater than you and your feelings. You have to serve it. It is not you. Some people will never understand that, but you need to surround yourself with people who do understand it. And you need to understand it yourself. Whatever you’re creating may come from within you and your life, but then—almost like a child, it comes out of your body and it grows up and walks away. It walks away and affects other people you don’t know and have never met. That’s the beauty of it, and the reason I keep trying new things. You never know who it will affect.”

Guilt is a shape-shifter. It can fester like a sore, burning for attention, or it can lurk like a beast in the dark, always there but never clearly visible. If you don’t look at it directly, it can seem as if it’s gone, and the only proof that it remains is the shadow it casts in the corner. My guilt comes out late at night or early in the morning, a specter that hovers over me as I drift into or out of sleep. Sometimes I like to see it. It can be seductive if it wants to. It knows exactly what I like. It knows precisely which memories to recall. Sometimes I hope it will never go away.

In fact, people who recover from trauma on their own tend to have much less intense memory of their traumas and are free of the need to repeatedly remember or track down every detail. It is also significant to note that a good portion of trauma victims suffer a worsening of symptoms when encouraged or forced to remember their traumas.

The goal of trauma healing must be to relieve, not intensify, suffering. Common sense requires improving quality of life to be the primary goal. Revisiting the horrors of the past should only be a part of the process when it serves this goal. That is not to say that trauma survivors should always feel good. That would not make any sense either. In recovering from any painful condition, there will be periods of discomfort. However, the discomfort of recovering from trauma must never compromise the individual’s life quality or ability to function normally on a day-to-day basis. A central principle of common sense I have always abided by is not to expect any two individuals to be alike. This includes traumatized individuals and their responses to recovery interventions. I would never expect one strategy to work exactly the same with two people. Recovery proceeds best when common sense is liberally applied to tailor any approach or program to the unique needs of each individual trauma survivor.

Perhaps she would have seen a symbol in her mind’s eye. Maybe a “Stop” or “Dead End” sign would have appeared to her had she known how to focus. There is no way to know, but Martha’s situation illuminates one area where mindfulness has the potential to be useful in facilitating trauma recovery and plotting a course of treatment.

The first mindful focus was to identify which signals were most obvious to Janice when she focused on decisions or options. I asked her to spend a week paying attention to simple tasks in her daily life such as deciding what to wear or eat. These basic choices could serve as a training ground for developing skill in this area of mindfulness. We first practiced together by having her choose a comfortable place to sit in the room with me. I asked her to move her chair to different distances and positions in relationship to the room and to where I was sitting, and to see what changed in her bodily sensations, her thoughts, or her mood. After trying several variations, she identified specific changes in her stomach sensations and also in her heart rate. When she sat close facing me directly, her heart would beat faster and her stomach felt twisted. She also noticed a picture in her mind of a scared rabbit. Moving her chair back a foot or so and turning it slightly to the right slowed her pulse. Her stomach felt more quiet and the rabbit in her mind’s eye looked happy. With several gauges identified, I suggested Janice continue practice as homework in situations where there was little to no risky emotional component. For the next week she would use heart rate, stomach sensations, and the rabbit image to help her decide which television program to watch, which toothpaste to use, what to order or bring for lunch, and so on. She thought these tasks were a bit simplistic as she was anxious to get to her touch issue. However, she agreed that the better she became at identifying fluctuations in her gauge when there was little risk of upset, the more skilled she would be in a stressful situation. I likened this training to learning to swim in the shallow end, spending some time only kicking or blowing bubbles before moving on to the deep end of the pool. The analogy made sense to her and she was able to be patient as she spent a week or so gaining proficiency in using her gauges.

Our attachment-based relationships take time and investment, and so when referring to attachment-based partners I am referring to a choice that we are making to intentionally cultivate and tend to the attachment-based needs within a particular relationship. Often, falling in love with someone or feeling attached to them does not feel like a choice we make, hence why we call it falling in love instead of stepping into love. Our attachment figures might be the people we feel levels of connection, compatibility or intensity with right from the start for reasons that we just can’t explain, or they may be the people with whom our romantic attachments have organically grown in potency and depth over time.

What aspects of commitment are most important to you (e.g., structural, emotional or public)? Why do we want to be attachment figures for each other? What does being an attachment figure look like to you? Do we each have the time and availability to offer this level of involvement?

In a 2018 talk on solo polyamory at the Boulder Non-Monogamy Talk Series, Kim Keane offered the following ways that people practicing nonmonogamy can demonstrate commitment to their partners: Sharing intimate details (hopes, dreams, fears) and being vulnerable with each other. Introducing partners to people who are important to you. Helping your partners with moving, packing, homework, job hunting, shopping, etc. Having regular time together, both mundane and novel. Making the person a priority. (I suggest defining what “being a priority” means to each of you.) Planning trips together. Being available to partners when they are sick or in need. Collaborating on projects together. Having frequent communication. Offering physical, logistical or emotional support (e.g. at doctor’s appointments or hospital visits or by helping with your partners’ family, pets, car, children, taxes, etc.).

Being a Secure Base for Each Other When safety is established with our attachment figures and we have an internalized felt sense that we can turn towards them and lean on them when needed, we are freed up to securely turn away from them and engage in the world, whether with them by our side or on our own. A secure base provides the platform from which we can move out in the larger world, explore and take risks. This exploration facilitates our sense of personal competence and healthy autonomy. Similar to how children want to show their parents their latest drawings, tricks, accomplishments or discoveries, as adults we need to share the new things we’ve learned, the things we’ve achieved and the things we’re excited about. Being and having a secure base in our partnerships means supporting each other’s personal growth and exploration, independent activities and other relationships, even when these actions require time apart from each other. Secure base partners will not only support our explorations, but will also offer guidance when solicited and lovingly call us on our shit. They function as a compassionate mirror for our blind spots and all the ways we may be fooling ourselves, whether through self-aggrandizement or self-limitation.

Examples of things that you and your partners can do to be secure bases for each other: Encourage each other’s personal growth and development. Support each other’s work and/or interests. Listen to each other’s hopes, dreams and visions. Listen when your partners share about their experiences in other relationships (assuming that the information shared is appropriate and consensual). Have conversations about things that are intellectually or emotionally stimulating to each other. Acknowledge each other’s capabilities and possibilities for growth. Compassionately bring light to your partner’s limitations and blind spots. Offer words of encouragement when your partners take on new responsibilities, go on dates with others, take a risk or learn something new. Secure Base Reflection Questions In each of your relationships that are attachment-based, or for the relationships that you would like to become more attachment-based, ask yourself: How is this partner already acting as a secure base for me? What does growth look like for me? Is it usually a shared or a personal experience, or both? Are there other ways that I want encouragement or support in my individual growth or with my visions and dreams? How could my partners support me in regard to my other relationships? How could I better support or encourage my partners’ dreams or aspirations to grow and develop? How could I better show genuine interest or curiosity in things that are important to my partners? How could I better support my partners in their other relationships?

A benefit of nonmonogamy is that you don’t have to provide or expect to receive all of this from one partner. Different partners can be more of a safe haven, a secure base or both, offering different facets of each. We all have different strengths and it can be wonderfully satisfying to have some partners that support you in safe haven ways, while others offer more of a secure base.

When attachment ruptures and traumas occur, we can lose access to the parts of ourselves that are able to be a safe haven through self-soothing, self-nurturance, self-compassion and self-acceptance, and to the parts of us that are able to be a secure base through self-encouragement, healthy standards, appropriate boundaries and alignment with our values.

Optimal functioning of the attachment system and the formation of attachment security are best facilitated by consistent interactions with significant others who are responsive to our needs for proximity. We need to know that our attachment figures are available to us, that they are within arm’s reach (literally and virtually) and that they will be available and responsive when we call for them. When we experience our partners as being here with us, it results in the positive beliefs that our partners care about us, we matter to them and we are worthy of their love and attention. Conversely, when our partners are unavailable, unresponsive or mentally elsewhere, attachment insecurity can arise, feeding the fears and doubts that we are not valued, loved or worthy.

Questions to Consider How do you already show expressed delight for your partners? Would your partners like more or different expressed delight from you? How can you provide this? How do your partners let you know that you are unique, special and precious to them? Are there additional or different ways that you would like to experience expressed delight from your partners? Are there certain situations (e.g., before or after your partner is out on a date with someone else) that expressed delight is more or less supportive to you and/or your partners? Things to Try and to Experiment With Let your partner know in spoken and/or written word how they enrich your life. Let your partner know in spoken and/or written word how unique and special they are to you. Let your partner know in spoken and/or written word the specific things that you love and appreciate about them. These should be based on who they are versus the things that they do for you. If you are less of a verbal type, make a meal, do a dance, create a piece of art or do something fitting to your style that is effective at intentionally representing and expressing to your partners how unique and precious they are to you. After spending time with a partner, let them know the things you enjoyed about your time together and what specific things they did that were meaningful to you. You can do this either right when you are saying goodbye, as you are going to bed together or within a few hours or days after you were together. With your partners, take on a gratitude practice where you set aside a regular time to each appreciate the ways in which they’ve been supportive or shown up that have been meaningful to each of you. You can share something your partner did that you are grateful for at the end of each day, or you can set aside a few minutes once a week to share your gratitude from the week.

When in a new relationship with someone, we rarely have to remind ourselves of this because everything in our body is easily oozing that this person is the eighth wonder of the world to us, but bringing this back in our longer-term relationships can support feeling that spark again. Seeing our partners giving the attachment gaze to other people might be painful when we are no longer in new relationship energy with that partner. Try intentionally sending the beam gleam to your partners and you will be pleasantly surprised at what it can do to feed each other’s attachment systems and strengthen your connection.

Attunement is a state of resonance with our partners and the act of turning towards them in an attempt to understand the fullness of their perspective and experience. Attuning to a partner does not mean that you have to agree with them and take on their experience as your own, but it does mean that you are willing to join them in their internal emotional world and their inner state of mind in order to empathize with what they are going through. Attunement is meeting your partner with curiosity, wanting to understand their feelings and needs. It is the feeling of being seen, understood and “gotten” by the other.

When I say that perception of sensation is context dependent, this is the deepest sense in which I mean it. I mean that evolutionarily old parts of your brain (your “monkey brain”) can respond in opposite ways, approach or avoidance, depending on the circumstances in which they are functioning.14 In a safe, comfortable environment, it hardly matters where you stimulate; you’ll activate approach, curiosity, desire.

There are actually three intertwined but separable functions in these deep, evolutionarily old parts of the brain: liking, wanting, and learning. These three mechanisms form the universal mammalian hardware that make, as Kent Berridge and Morten Kringelbach geekily put it, “One hedonic brain system to mediate them all.”

The sequence works this way: Something sex-related happens, and your brain goes, “Hey, that’s sex-related.” That’s learning. And if the context is right, your brain also goes, “Hey, that’s nice!” That’s liking. And if the stimulus is nice enough, your brain goes, “Ooh, go get more of that!” That’s wanting.

The key to managing stress (so that it doesn’t mess with your sex life) is not simply “relaxing” or “calming down.” It’s allowing the stress response cycle to complete. Allow it to discharge fully. Let your body move all the way from “I am at risk” to “I am safe.”

“In my mind, romance is just showing someone that you know them, you’re thinking of them, you care about them, and you want them to know it. There’s nothing wrong with chocolates and flowers and even grand gestures if that’s what someone genuinely likes, if that’s what makes them feel appreciated. Because that’s romance. It depends on what your love language is.”

You have to be with someone that deserves your faith and you have to be deserving of someone else’s. It’s sacred.

At all the funerals for love, love had its neat trick of making you mourn it so much, it reappeared. Popped right up from the casket. Or, if it didn’t reappear itself, it sent a relative of startling resemblance, a thin and charming twin, which you took back home with you to fatten and cradle, nuzzle and scold.

Sasha liked everyone better when they were in pain, especially people she loved. She wasn’t a particularly empathetic person, and when her loved ones suffered she became hyperaware of the ways in which she was not filled with their pain, not beholden to it. This awareness gave her the strength to tap into something of a euphoric stoicism, offering endless emotional support and unlimited analytical processing.

anything, pleased to have seen Rob, pleased to have been dragged from his bed and into what could only be trouble. The boy who had answered the door returned, carrying a lantern and a parcel. “Da said to give you these,” he said, following his words with a yawn. Rob thanked the lad with a wink and another halfpenny, then took the lantern and parcel. Marian saddled the mare, aware that Rob’s eyes were on her. Likely he didn’t believe that she knew how to ride and was waiting for her to make a false step. But she had been saddling her own mounts since she could be trusted not to either fall off a horse or get kicked in the head by one, and a year of inactivity was hardly going to rob her of a lifetime’s worth of experience. She adjusted the mare’s bridle and set the stirrups at a length that looked suitable, then swung herself into the saddle. Meanwhile, Rob began whispering to his own horse. Of course he was one of those people who insisted on talking to animals. Marian preferred to communicate with horses in their own language: she rode them well and not too hard and made sure they were fed and watered. That was what horses cared about; everything else was mere self-indulgence. She took the opportunity to adjust the folds of her cloak and retrieve her coin purse, removing slightly more than Rob had paid for the horses. “This is yours,” she said, holding out her hand. He took the coins and counted them, as if Marian meant to cheat him, the insufferable man. “This is too much,” he said. “I didn’t have smaller coins.” “Christ,” he muttered. “Of course she doesn’t.” He dropped the coins into his own money pouch and mounted the horse. “When we get out of the city, you ride close by me, you hear?” With that, he rode out of the stableyard and Marian was left to follow behind.

Schooled to believe that we find ourselves in relation with others, females learn early to search for love in a world beyond our own hearts. We learn in childhood that the roots of love lie outside our capabilities, that to know love we must be loved by others. For as females in patriarchal culture, we cannot determine our self-worth. Our value, our worth, and whether or not we can be loved are always determined by someone else. Deprived of the means to generate self-love, we look to others to render us lovable; we long for love and we search.

He would probably always be there, by her side, if that was what she wanted. That was terrifying—it felt like more responsibility being shoved in her direction, as if she didn’t already have enough.

But now, three years later, as Reese’s odometer clicked up into her midthirties, she began to think about what she called the Sex and the City Problem. The Sex and the City Problem wasn’t just Reese’s problem, it was a problem for all women. But unlike millions of cis women before Reese, no generation of trans women had ever solved it. The problem could be described thusly: When a woman begins to notice herself aging, the prospect of making some meaning out of her life grows more and more urgent. A need to save herself, or be saved, as the joys of beauty and youth repeat themselves to lesser and lesser effect. But in finding meaning, Reese would argue—despite the changes wrought by feminism—women still found themselves with only four major options to save themselves, options represented by the story arcs of the four female characters of Sex and the City. Find a partner, and be a Charlotte. Have a career, and be a Samantha. Have a baby, and be a Miranda. Or finally, express oneself in art or writing, and be a Carrie. Every generation of women reinvented this formula over and over, Reese believed, blending it and twisting it, but never quite escaping it.

Wasn’t that the big lesson of transition, of detransition? That you’ll never know all the angles, that delay is a form of hiding from reality. That you just figure out what you want and do it? And maybe, if you don’t know what you want, you just do something anyway, and everything will change, and then maybe that will reveal what you really want. So do something.

“Yes and no. Some days I still love you and some days I don’t.” Reese waited, sensing there was more. So he let her have as much of the truth as he could bear. “But the days I don’t love you…I have to work hard to make those days happen. The days I do require nothing of me. You were the most important person in my life for so long, and then…then everything went wrong and we just disappeared to each other. When I think about raising this child with you, well, it feels like a kind of redemption. Romantically, fuck, who knows if we would ever be right for each other again? It all fell apart so badly that I hesitate to even hope for that. But if we weren’t meant to be lovers, it doesn’t mean that we weren’t meant to be family. Every single time I remember the state of things between us, I want to cry. I thought it would fade, but it hasn’t; it’s just changed. If we don’t try again, it’s like our time together…Not only did it end, it was like it never was.”

It feels like such a sweet and visceral release, and yet the minute it comes out of my mouth, I wish I never said it. I wish I was the sort of person who doesn’t need her pain to be heard. I want to be the type of person who can keep it to herself and spare the feelings of others. But I’m not that person. My anger has to take flight. It has to be set free and allowed to bounce off the walls and into the ears of the person it could hurt the most.

These letters are the evidence of how ugly our marriage has become and yet proof that we are tied to each other. We can hate and love, miss and loathe each other all within the same breath. We can never want to see each other again while never wanting to let go. He hates me as much as he loves me. I hate these letters as much as I love them. The pain and the joy are locked together, tightly bound. I read the letters over and over again, hoping to separate one from the other, hoping to discern whether love or hate wins out in the end. But it’s like pulling on the ends of a finger trap. The more I try, the tighter they cling to each other.

He said in his letters that he feels like he often didn’t tell me how he really felt. That he kept a lot of stuff inside just to make things easier, and then he started to resent me. I did that, too! I would sometimes choose to just go along with what he wanted or what he said so that I didn’t cause a fight. And somewhere along the way, I started to feel like I couldn’t be honest. Does that make sense? Things became so tense, and I started to resent him so much that I was suddenly furious about everything, and I didn’t know where to start. I think he feels the same way. This could be an opportunity for us. This could be what we need. If it were me writing to him, trying to bare my soul, trying to show the real me, I would want him to read it.” I shrug. “I would want him to see the real me.”

That’s a problem, because for bi people the illusion of acceptance can do more harm than good. While normalization has many upsides, it can also have a silencing effect, perpetuating the assumption that being bi is “not a big deal.” Bisexuality tends to feel ubiquitous and thus irrelevant, as if the subject isn’t worth our time.

On that last note, one of my favorite unlearning techniques is to look at any stereotype, assumption, or injustice, and simply ask: Why? If, like an incredulous three-year-old, we keep repeating that one-word question, each answer will bring us closer to our world’s deepest truths. It’s like peeling an onion—the more layers we remove, the more we’ll confront ideas that are so entrenched within our realities that we wouldn’t have dared to question them outright. Sometimes it’s hard to see that there was an onion in the first place. And, to fully round out this metaphor, sometimes peeling that onion can make us cry.

The problem isn’t promiscuity—it’s patriarchy, which vilifies sex and dismisses non-monogamy. The problem isn’t confusion—it’s binaries, which encourage us to make finite decisions (usually between two constructs that we never got to choose in the first place). The problem isn’t being greedy—it’s that systems function better when we don’t demand what we deserve.

Characters rarely identified themselves as bisexual out loud—instead they behaved their bisexuality, usually through an illicit queer hookup (followed by a breakdown because they’re so “confused”). This taught me that bisexuality was something you do, rather than something you are. And since I hadn’t “done it” yet, I figured I was straight.

Even then, my vision of womanhood was hardly mine at all. To this day, it can be hard to tell where I end and the male gaze begins.

we are ever unsure about what femme should be or how to be femme, we must move toward the ugly. Not just the ugly in ourselves, but the people and communities that are ugly, undesirable, unwanted, disposable, hidden, displaced. This is the only way that we will ever create a femme-ness that can hold physically disabled folks, dark-skinned people, trans and gender non-conforming folks, poor and working-class folks, HIV-positive folks, people living in the global south and so many more of us who are the freaks, monsters, criminals, villains of our fairy tales, movies, news stories, neighborhoods and world. At first I found this tough to wrap my head around—wasn’t ugliness something we wanted to avoid? But sitting with Mingus’s work helped me understand that ugliness was also a socially constructed idea, which meant my fear of it had been socially constructed too. Inherently, “ugly” wasn’t good or bad. It was simply a word—a word that was often employed to degrade disabled people, trans people, fat people, non-white people, and others who didn’t fit into a narrow, colonial vision of “perfection.”

For answers to this question, read Katherine Angel’s Tomorrow Sex Will Be Good Again. She writes that consent is far from enough, especially for women to enjoy sex: “The rhetoric of consent too often implies that desire is something that lies in wait, fully formed within us, ready for us to extract. Yet our desires emerge in interaction; we don’t always know what we want… [This] must be folded into the ethics of sex rather than swept aside as an inconvenience.”

The piece argued that we need to reframe the entire way we think about sexual violence—as long as we see it through a binary lens (e.g., consensual/not consensual, legal/illegal, okay/not okay), the burden will still fall on survivors to definitively say “no.” Shim pointed out that even the affirmative consent model was far from survivor-centric: “Why is it that in so many purportedly ‘feminist’ opinions and re-writings, Ansari’s actions remain unchanged, while Grace is the one who must be stronger, better, smarter, faster?”

Years later, I learned a catchy word to describe this phenomenon: homonormativity. (At least it’s slightly catchier than, say, “neoliberal hegemony of the queer community at large.”) Professor Lisa Duggan popularized the term, writing, “We have been administered a kind of political sedative—we get marriage and the military, then we go home and cook dinner forever.” Her point was that if we only focus on equality, we’ll only end up achieving assimilation. While that’s still a form of progress,V there’s a blatant cognitive dissonance in associating “queer liberation” with access to straight white institutions.

These days when I don’t feel “queer enough,” I try to remember that queerness isn’t a box to check—it isn’t even tied to a goal. Queerness exists as a vehicle—an engine that stokes our curious brains, conjuring new ideas for what tomorrow could become. Queerness has the power to launch us into Muñoz’s “collective futurity,” a world where community remains fundamental to everything we do. If we can shed the weight of individualism, we can achieve so much more than assimilation. We can soar past “equality” until that concept is far behind us, just a tiny blinking star.

Tbh seems like ppl are scared of male bisexuality bc it threatens masculinity. Masculinity as a concept is supposed to be all decisive and sure of itself (eye roll). But as you and I both know, bisexuality is associated with confusion, fluidity, multiple options, etc—and all of those are seen as “feminine” (or at least not masc). That means bi men are embracing their “feminine” side in multiple ways. The gender binary is SHAKING.

Beyond logistical headaches, there’s also a sense of grief. You are, in fact, saying goodbye to your friend as a single human entity; farewell to them as you know them to be. English is far from a perfect language, but could there be a more perfect encapsulation for loss of individualism than this shift from one letter to two? The “I” character stands tall and defiant. It autocorrects itself to being capitalized, no matter where in the sentence it lives. But when transformed to “we,” it shrinks down, both letters making themselves smaller to meet at the other’s eye level. Sure, w and e are still unique—a consonant toward the end of the alphabet and a vowel near the top certainly make an unlikely pair. But no matter who these letters are by themselves, at this point they’re nothing without each other. When the “we” arrives digitally, it’s manageable—at least you’ll have space to process your feelings in peace. But if you’re unlucky, it will come when your best friend sits you down and breaks the news: “I think we are moving to LA.”

In hindsight, all my love stories with men had only been performances—one-woman shows furthering the True Love agenda, perpetuating the harmful idea that a woman’s sole purpose is to provide sex and free therapy to her husband until one of them dies. Sure, a feminist can still “fall in love,” but she should do it only if it’s what she wants. But where’s the line? There’s things we want, and then there’s things the world tells us to want. But how can we determine where one ends and the other begins?

This isn’t to say that healthy relationships with cis men cannot exist—just that it seems like they cannot exist for me.

Queer Love, it turns out, is everything True Love wishes it could be, and the same goes for Queer Love stories—they’re the best kind of love stories because they’re forced to self-determine, which means they do their own world-building (Lord of the Rings, but make it gay… er than it already is). David Halperin writes, “Love has seemed too intimately bound up with institutions and discourses of the ‘normal,’ too deeply embedded in standard narratives of romance, to be available for ‘queering.’ ” Queer Love then requires us to create something entirely new—it must be different than the heteronormative, patriarchal tropes from whence we came.

Before I go any further with this and wake the “BuT WhAt AbOuT sTrAiGhT pRiDe” crowd, I should clarify: You don’t have to be an LGBTQ+ person to experience Queer Love. The only thing queer love requires is authenticity, and you can have that no matter who your partner(s) is/are. You can also lack it—being queer doesn’t inherently make you down-to-earth (see: Jeffree Star, Rachel Dolezal, or Ursula in The Little Mermaid).VIII I’m no authenticity role model either: I’ve been bisexual my whole life, thus all of my relationships with men were *technically* queer relationships. But was I honest? Did I show up with my full self? The tattoo I got to impress a high school crush says no. (Actually it says “this too shall pass” and I’m in the process of getting it removed.) People tend to focus on the practical appeal of queer relationships—plenty of think pieces have celebrated these bonds for the way they transcend gender roles. When sexism doesn’t tell you who should cook, who cooks? The better cook. Beautiful. But as I said, a Queer Love story isn’t just a straight love story featuring queer people—it’s about a love that is rooted in radical, asymmetrical truth. Queer Love is inherently political—an action that bell hooks defined as “the practice of freedom.”IX Queer Love takes up space—it is earth-shattering and expansive, yet somehow remains vulnerable even in its strongest form. When I say Queer Love, I don’t mean love in a legal sense. I don’t mean domestic partnerships, divorces, or whatever it’s called when two white gays start a joint TikTok account. When I say Queer Love, I mean love that makes its own rules.

Your love doesn’t deserve this burden, the task of erasing your sense of lack. You now understand that your fluidity makes you high-maintenance—it requires constant validation, a steady stream of “yes, you exist.” Brinley gives that to you—through their gender, but also by not treating your history with men like a past life you need to shed. They validate you when the two of you talk about the future, and agree that you could fuck with polyamory someday. They validate you when they tease you about the time you dated Ben. They validate you when they refer to you in the third person—“if the bisexual wants takeout, guess we’re getting takeout!” (Sure, that’s just how they flirt, but if there’s one thing that’s bi culture, it’s feeling affirmed by a joke.)

They knew that they weren’t supposed to make decisions to accommodate other people’s comfort (and their Instagram caption had claimed to be done with that, anyway), but how could they ignore other people when other people had the power to make them feel whole? Andrea Long Chu writes, “If there is any lesson of gender transition—from the simplest request regarding pronouns to the most invasive surgeries—it’s that gender is something other people have to give you. Gender exists, if it is to exist at all, only in the structural generosity of strangers.”

It took me decades to realize what Jessica had known from the beginning: I had constructed an impossible box to live inside. The box could accommodate only two people, a man and a woman, and even then, it couldn’t accommodate full versions of them. I picked the things from my mom’s marriage that looked good—the house, the kids, the photo albums filled with shots of trips to Europe and anniversary dinners—and discarded anything remotely off-color. I understood that this was a challenge: I would have my mom’s marriage, only better and healthier. I would have my mom’s life, only fuller and richer, because I would have selected exactly the right man to shove into my tiny box life. There was no space for female friendship (who needed female friends? My mom didn’t seem to have any), and there was no space for ambition outside the box (job schmob, dreams schmeams; a good husband would trump all of those).

The years between 1996 and 2008—my formative ones—were the highest-grossing box office years for romantic comedies in history.8 The top five performing rom-com feature films came out before I was old enough to be legally married.

He examines the three types of friendship in book VIII of Nicomachean Ethics: friendship based on utility (like when your boss invites you out for drinks, and you kind of have to get along because you both need each other), friendship based on pleasure (like when you have a one-night stand with the hot barista because she thinks you’re hot, too), and then that really good sort of friendship that practically defies explanation. Aristotle describes this as a “complete sort of friendship between people who are good and alike in virtue.” It comes from being good, finding someone else who is good, and loving, unsuperficially, the goodness in each other.

According to social scientists, there are a few indicators that your failed romantic relationship might transition into a successful platonic one. If a relationship ends on a positive, amicable note, for example, your chances of staying friends are significantly higher.6 A longstanding friendship preceding a romantic relationship—as Ben and I had in high school—also bodes well.7 But what matters the most is how invested, committed, and satisfied each person in a romantic relationship is. The more a person is happy with her partner—the more she says she cares—the more likely it is that she’ll maintain a healthy friendship with that partner after the romantic relationship has ended. I know—this totally goes against that whole “If we’re not passionately fighting all the time, the fire just isn’t there” stereotype you may have grown up believing. In truth, there are some ways in which relationships don’t change all that much after the people in them stop kissing each other. Real love isn’t easy to stamp out; you hold on to your affection even after you stop wanting to have sex.

I wish it hadn’t taken an unusually positive experience with an ex to teach me how great friendship can be, but it did. The love I feel for Ben is more than friendship but less than romantic.

“Relationship anarchy questions the idea that love is a limited resource that can only be real if restricted to a couple. You have capacity to love more than one person, and one relationship and the love felt for that person does not diminish love felt for another.”10 Relationship anarchy embraces ideas around spontaneity, freedom, respect, values, and a rejection of possession and entitlement. The term is gaining traction.

use the word “polyamory” is that there tends to be too much emphasis on sex. In some of my social circles, “polyamory” and “hookup culture” are synonymous. In my personal experience, the two couldn’t be farther apart. Aren’t there relationships that fall somewhere between platonic and nonplatonic? Isn’t there love that exists beyond “friendship” and outside of “lover” and paradoxically both inside and outside of “family”?

In his essay “For Lovers and Fighters,” Dean Spade writes that one of his goals in being polyamorous is to treat his lovers more like his friends, and his friends more like his lovers. One of the problems with dating just one person is that he sees “people prioritizing romantic relationships over all else—ditching their friends, putting all their emotional eggs in one basket, and creating unhealthy dynamics with the people they date because of it. It becomes simultaneously the most important relationship and the one where people act out of their most insecure selves.”

“The freedom of surrendering to love and allowing love—not just sexual passion, not just social norms and religious strictures, not just emotional reactions and unconscious conditioning—to determine the shape our intimate relationships take is the essence of polyamory.”12 She adds that polyamory “involves a conscious decision to act altruistically, that is, to put the well-being of others on an equal par with one’s own.”13 To me, that’s what being a really good friend is all about. Polyamory is the continuation of the life we left behind when we hit puberty and, hypothetically, started searching for a singular perfect mate. It’s the bringing-enough-cupcakes-for-the-whole-class deal: try to treat everyone with equal intention toward love, generosity, and respect, and see where it takes you.

Women are especially good at this, psychiatrists Jean Baker Miller and Irene Pierce Stiver point out: they engage in what Miller and Stiver call “connective” conversations—conversations that are uniquely healing, and, unfortunately, critically absent in public discourse. According to Miller and Stiver, connectivity occurs when both people engaged in a conversation are equally invested and share the emotional weight of the conversation’s experience. “Connection in this sense does not depend upon whether the feelings are happy or sad or something else; it means having feelings with another person, aside from the specific nature of the feelings.”14 Conversation with Hannah was long and easy because we were not necessarily seeking solutions to our problems. In discussing the pleasures and pains of our daily lives, we constructed reality together. I know this is convoluted and theoretical-sounding, so here’s an example. Around the time of this trip, I was going through a particularly rough falling-out with a group of comedians I had been producing shows with for about a year and a half.

The focus on emotion rather than solution drives the conversation and allows things to come out that we may not have been expecting. In the example on the next page, Hannah was having some serious feelings about her relationship with coworker Rory and the ways in which Rory exploited Hannah’s friendship in order to hurt Other Rory. That came up later, and the emotional space then shifted to fit Hannah’s pain and frustration. This kind of conversation is hard to explain in words. Miller and Stiver spend 248 pages trying to do it in their book, and even then, they’re hard-pressed to explain this kind of conversation to people who don’t regularly engage in it (read: most heterosexual cis-gendered men).

One of the things people seem to not be able to understand about connective conversations is why a person would want to engage in them if the conversation isn’t going to solve any problems: “Our society tends to portray and value action as the result of the forceful exertion of the lone individual.”15 I guess this had a lot to do with my childhood belief that it was the job of a good girlfriend to swoop in and solve every problem. Sometimes I don’t need a solution nearly as much as I need to be told that whatever crazy thing I’m feeling—terrified of going to sleep at night; palpably angry at the bagel guy for working at an establishment that has run out of poppy-seed bagels; in love, unconditionally, with people who can’t love me back—is an okay thing to feel. I’m constantly amazed at the ways in which our world seems to believe that uncomfortable feelings are abnormal and should be avoided or fixed at all costs. I’ve worked with counselors, therapists, psychiatrists, and spiritual mentors throughout my life. I’ve been on antidepressants and antianxiety medications for my particular brand of crazy. Hannah never tries to fix my problems; she sits with me in their shadows, engaging with the darkness until it passes.

We want to look over and see that people are still there, were there all along, and will be there for the foreseeable future. Do you really need this love to look the way you thought it was going to look? Does it have to be a man, two kids, and a golden retriever?

I don’t love the Lean In mentality because it suggests that in order to make the business world better, women have to adjust to a culture that has been created by men. They must adapt to a male-dominated structure in order to get what they want. In dating, however, I wish women would ask for what they wanted. In the world of love and sex, asking for what you want—not demanding but asking—is not a game; it’s the definition of communication. Granted, all this speculation is very heteronormative. Women flirting with other women likely have different success rates (oh-so-shockingly, there’s basically no long-term research on this subject), as must men flirting with men. And also, “batting out of their league”? Come on, researchers. That’s not a real thing.

I wanted to avoid them for all the same reasons that anyone who has just been dumped avoids them: the idea of getting hurt again is both terrifying and exhausting. Unfortunately, for many of us, there isn’t a proverbial wall we can construct to keep intimate emotions out. But I wanted to have orgasms, and one-night stands weren’t getting me there. I’m not saying they can’t work for anyone, but I do think there are other people like me who need time and practice with a partner to have truly incredible sex. So what was I supposed to do?

For example, when Ben and I broke up, I didn’t feel like I loved him any less, but I also no longer felt the kind of chemistry that made me want to have sex with him. Somehow I found a way to communicate that and Ben found a way to believe it, and we’ve been able to hold the word “love” between us for more than a decade. On the other hand, when Sam broke up with me, he told me he didn’t love me anymore. Years later, I wonder if that was really true.

Relationships get messy when two people want different things. A dangerous power dynamic can emerge if one person is more invested than the other, and ultimately, someone—or, more likely, both people—get wounded in the fray. This is definitely a flaw in my love-on-a-continuum relationship model. On the other hand, it’s a flaw in any relationship model. The other major flaw, of course, is time-related. I was never able to balance more than three romantic relationships at a time, and to be honest, maintaining even the three felt like I was pushing myself a little too hard. To get to know the jazz musician, the punk musician, and the special-education teacher intimately, I had to spend hours with them independently. If all I did in my life was date musicians and teachers, this would be almost manageable.

There weren’t enough hours in the day, and frequently time management was the underlying cause of a romantic relationship fizzling into a casual friendship.

Importantly, sex is generally (but not always) what separates platonic relationships from romantic ones. And so it should go without saying that sexual compatibility is incredibly important when forming romantic bonds with someone. This is something Dan Savage talks about a lot in his column and on his podcast: while he concedes that “other shit matters, too, of course—stuff like emotional compatibility, similar life goals, being on the same page about kids, etc.,” he emphasizes that basic sexual compatibility is essential. “Its absence will eventually undermine everything else.”4

One of the most wonderful things about polyamory is that it allows you to acknowledge that you will have similarities and differences with the people in your life; maybe the person with whom you’re most sexually compatible isn’t the same person with whom you’re most emotionally compatible, and that’s okay—because you can prioritize both of those people in significant ways. If sex is a major part of your life (it’s a major part of my life), it’s worth knowing a little about what you want so that you can put it on the table when you start to enter into new partnerships.

After reading the article, I took to my blog and unloaded: “This relationship, for the first time in my life, is about taking care of myself and loving myself first and foremost; then trusting that [he] will do the same for himself; and then working together to build support and recognize not only each other, but the other people we are seeing. At the end of the day, being in my own ‘monogamish’ relationship feels like a pretty big commitment. It feels like I have a partner who is invested in his own happiness, just as he is invested in mine (and vice versa). That means being honest about what we want, and trusting each other to talk about it.”1

I would love to tell you that Jaedon and I got to a place where processing took less time, but we never did. On the other hand, I do think we processed things very civilly. We never yelled at each other, and we didn’t interrupt each other, either. We listened, reflected, empathized, took long breaths, rescheduled appointments to “honor this conversation,” and had reassuring after-processing sex over and over again. In fact, these conversations were at the center of why I felt that we were so committed to each other. They took a long time, and they were utterly respectful. As I listened to Jaedon and argued with Jaedon, I thought, “I have never loved someone as much as I do this person right now.”

In practice, at least for me and for the people I’ve loved, this moment is secretly stomach-turning and terrifying and exhilarating. Your body revolts against your mind; you want to feel chill and laid back, but instead you get a whole mess of emotions you didn’t ask for.

In practice, at least for me and for the people I’ve loved, this moment is secretly stomach-turning and terrifying and exhilarating. Your body revolts against your mind; you want to feel chill and laid back, but instead you get a whole mess of emotions you didn’t ask for. With Jaedon and Luke, I was in the arguably easier position. I had the power because I was in control, I believed, of where my love went. I trusted myself to continue to be committed to Jaedon, and that was easy to do because I spend a lot of time in my own brain, monitoring my emotions. Jaedon was the one who had to wonder. If I stayed out an hour later than I had planned to, he had to wonder why. If I wanted to take Luke to a movie or a concert or a book reading, Jaedon had to wonder why I hadn’t invited him. He had to trust me—a person he’d known for only a year—to keep my promises and keep him safe. I was holding him over a ledge, and he had to trust that I wasn’t going to drop him.

Luke asked me what animal I was at heart (I know—this date was interesting and whimsical!), and I told Luke that I thought I was a macaw. Macaws are vegetarians, they’re big and loud, and, hauntingly, they self-mutilate when they feel distressed or lonely (by plucking out their feathers). This, incidentally, was the cutest way I’d ever found to tell a person that I struggle with self-mutilation. Luke perked up, telling me that he would be a bird, too.

I couldn’t see how I could possibly maintain a relationship with Jaedon and go through these falling-in-love motions with Luke at the same time. I didn’t know how Jaedon was supposed to not feel jealous when I told him about this extraordinary mixtape. I didn’t know how Luke was supposed to continue to want to make me mixtapes if I was always spending Valentine’s Day with someone else. Everything felt, in the moment, too heightened to last. Later, I would learn that there are ways to make nearly any romantic situation—even impossible-seeming ones—work. In this case, though, I was right. My priorities around Jaedon and Luke started to change. I began wanting to spend more time with Luke than Jaedon was comfortable with. There were only a few times that Jaedon and Luke and I all ended up at the same event—sometimes I did big comedy shows and invited them both, because you’re supposed to hustle tickets when you’re trying to make it in stand-up. I always decided beforehand which of them I was going to hang out with after the show; that decision was usually discussed with Jaedon first, and then communicated to Luke. I remember standing awkwardly between Jaedon and Luke outside an indie movie theater one time after a show, just before Luke and I were about to head out for dessert. Jaedon and Luke kept calling each other “man”—as in, “Hey, man, how are you?” “Yeah, man, I’m good, I’m good; what about you?” The exchange was uncomfortable, like when you and your new partner run into an ex. Only in this case, no one was anyone’s ex—at least, not yet.

Jesse broke up with me, and I was totally crushed—but I’d assured him that I would care about him no matter what shape our relationship needed to take, and I was going to keep my promise, period. I invited him to dinner every week. I told him about the shows I was in at the comedy theater. I went to his house when he invited all his friends over—even though I knew the new girl he was sleeping with would be there—because I was his friend, and this “conscious uncoupling” was going to be different than all the other breakups I’d had in the past. It didn’t matter that I hated him. I hated him and hated him and hated him—until I didn’t. At some point, after dinners and movie nights and calls to his mother in Florida, I began to see Jesse as a different man who existed outside the context of my past relationship with him, and I enjoyed having him around. For example: He knew a lot about birds. He told me once about how he watched hummingbirds harvest spiderwebs to build their nests, and I couldn’t think of anything more beautiful in the world. Over lunch, when it was just the two of us, Jesse would still tell me how sad he was. In those moments, all I could think about was how much I wanted this person to be happy. In fact, in those moments, it was all I wanted. And so, months after we broke up, I started to tell him that I loved him. And he said he loved me, too. The next spring, Jesse prepared to work on a farm where his ex would also be working. I asked if they were back together. No, he said, his ex was seeing a woman now, and it seemed serious; but he still cared for her very much, and he was interested in seeing what would happen over the summer they spent together. It surprised me that I didn’t feel jealous. I am, historically, a very jealous person. I like to have control over the people in my life, even if I don’t like to admit it. I loved Jesse so much, and it surprised me that I didn’t want to possess him. But I found myself hoping that things would go well with this woman, that maybe some healing could take place. I was actually discovering something very important about polyamory: it’s not so much about letting the people you love sleep around and attend exotic sex parties with frisky, leather-clad barmaids (clearly I know nothing of that world, as I’m pretty sure the barmaid thing went out of style in the 1980s); it’s not really about letting the people you love do anything. It’s more about allowing yourself to let go. In releasing whatever possession you think you have over another person, you give yourself permission to not worry about it. Mistrust is a heavy burden to have to lug around all the time.

Prioritizing my friendship with Jessica over my relationship with Rory felt unnatural. I’d grown up believing that romantic partnership trumped all the other friendships there were. As a result, I often got frustrated with my romantic partners for not being able to provide what my friends could—long, bubbly conversations about Ben Folds Five; long, serious conversations about childhood emotional trauma; or honest-but-friendly advice about what to wear to a costume party. It took a while for me to understand that I could have both kinds of relationships in my life; the important thing was that I actively prioritize each of them.

Romance and capitalism are so enmeshed that our aspirations of love often include aspirations of money. Focus Features even marketed Fifty Shades of Grey with a digital tour of Christian’s penthouse apartment, proving that the fantasy was as much about being rich as it was about BDSM. As icing on the proverbial wedding cake of horrors, the concept of True Love has always been heteronormative. That said, it’s important to note this flawed ideology isn’t just reserved for straight people—it’s equal opportunity bullshit, happy to ruin your life no matter how you identify. Anyone of any gender can blame True Love if they care more about being in “a relationship” than they care about the person they’re in said relationship with. While the myth of True Love hurts everyone, it’s patriarchal in nature, meaning it comes for women and femmes especially hard. On top of all the other nonsense we’re supposed to live up to, we’re also supposed to become “the perfect wife.”

So I don’t have hang-ups about how to reconcile those parts of me, because I don’t think they clash.”

When I say “my wife” to someone I’ve just met, it’s like coming out on speed—they have to get it right away. I’ve also noticed a profound shift in how I think of the meaning of “wife.” Whereas when I was married to a man, the word seemed like the necessarily subordinate half of a male/female-oriented binary, now it is much more powerful—not genderless, but unmoored from a system that privileges men—and, on a day-to-day basis, it’s a cause for celebration. In many ways, I’m more of a wife to Cheryl than I was to my ex-husband, and she’s more of a husband to me than he was (although I don’t use that word to describe her). I do most of the cooking and take pleasure in tending to and nurturing her. She manages our budget and keeps the house in check. She has a job that puts her out in the world more than mine; I’m happiest when I’m working at home. She makes more money and gets greater recognition for her work than I do (she’s a two-time Grammy nominee), and she moves in circles of powerful and influential people, where I’m often identified as a “plus one.” Yet I don’t feel diminished by such things that in a heterosexual marriage might be viewed as just par for the course if she were in fact a man. Her power and status aren’t the by-product of gender—the music business is still an old boy’s club—and our household interactions revolve around decided preferences and skill sets, rather than prescribed traditional roles.

In random moments it floods back without warning. Like a quick punch in the gut I remember all that I have done, all that has been lost. The pain is so fierce I question how much I can take. And I wonder, will I ever feel whole and complete again? I already find it hard to remember so much. The last time I kissed my husband. The last time we made love. All the other seemingly inconsequential moments that usually pass by unnoticed. What about the last time we took the kids to the park? The last time we put groceries in the same cart? What was the last movie we watched together? Where did we go the last time we rode together in the car? When did we last say, “I love you”? When did I last lay my head against his chest and feel peace? I don’t know the answer to any of these questions, and sometimes I want to scream. I didn’t mean for any of this to happen. When did it end? Was there one specific final moment, or just a combination of lasts too numerous to count? If I had known that none of those things would happen again, how much longer would I have held on?

I am on the floor of my bedroom closet. It is midnight and I keep the door closed so the sounds of my sobs will not be heard by anyone in the small two-bedroom apartment we now call home. Hot tears slide down my cheeks and emotions shake my body. I cry not just for tonight and tomorrow, but for all the countless moments of our lives when we will not be together. I cry for the reality that my daughters will forever be moving between two places, instead of resting securely in one. I cry for him and all that he has lost in the wake of my truth. I cry because the costs are so much higher than anyone could have possibly imagined. Self-pity, grief, and endless, all consuming guilt. It is a vicious combination.

How can it feel for her, I wonder, when every adult memory I have involves us or includes him? She must notice how often my stories begin with “he did,” or “we went,” or “he always.” One-third of my life spent by his side. Sometimes it feels like those are the only memories I have.

I look at her and realize something is different now; something has changed. Suddenly, I know what it is. I am here with her, fully present, in this reality. This now. This life. Our life. A few weeks ago I was struck with a powerful vision. It stayed with me long enough that I could record it in the battered black fabric journal that has held so much of this story. I was holding something small, cradling it in the palm of my hand, and feeling filled with love and bittersweet nostalgia. The object was heavy and warm and egg-shaped, and I was wrapping it carefully and tenderly in something very soft. With all the gentleness in the world, I tucked it away in a very protected and private space. This thing would always ache, but I knew that I didn’t need it anymore, that I could care for it without keeping it close. Tonight I finally understand what the vision represented. The object that I tucked away with so much love was the part of my heart and soul that lived in the past. The part that belonged to him and us, and the life we had together. It is time to move on, to give myself a chance to live fully, to open my heart and to step into our future. And so I smile back to her, burrow my head into the curve of her neck, and we keep on dancing.

Extracting yourself from a cocoon takes time, fierce resolve, a willingness to be exquisitely vulnerable. It feels safer to stay in the space you’re used to, cramped and dark but familiar. Everyone sees that inspiring transformation from caterpillar to butterfly, but did you know that the process of unfurling your wings hurts like hell?

Jo was less afraid of my orientation at this point than of my shutting down and pulling away. We had always been one of those tell-each-other-everything couples. This was entirely new ground for us and I was struggling to include him in my process. I wanted to be sensitive to his experience, yet some days I felt powerless to do so. Years of pent-up emotions and desires were flooding out of me at breakneck speed. Some days it just felt impossible to deal with anyone else’s feelings. We both held on for dear life, some days to each other, other days simply to our history together, and hoped something good was on the other side.

Naturally, I will always remember my first time with a woman in sexual terms. It exceeded my high erotic expectations. But beyond that, I remember it as what it feels like to be myself. Me sleeping with a woman turned out to be about as natural as it is for fish to swim, and Jo really took such a legitimate unfolding of my true self as something to be celebrated. At the same time, there was also a big pill of reality for him to swallow in knowing that his wife had fully unleashed herself this way. In the context of our relationship, it felt like the peaceful silence that comes after someone has said something brutally honest. I will always remember my husband’s response to that experience: he felt that it was more important for me to be myself than for him to feel secure. I had never felt more myself, nor more loved.

For him, the insecurity that I will leave him for a woman has, naturally, taken many conversations to sort through, and is something we expect to always cycle through as we continue to dialogue about our needs. For me, coming to peace with the very real loss that I am not partnered with a woman has taken much time to accept. We are each choosing to sacrifice because we love being together. Is it complicated? Yes! But I believe that coming out and sexual rights are, at their core, about the right to freely be our full selves.

The interesting thing about this is that it makes me value my identity all the more. It keeps me aware of how important it is for all of us to have the room we need to freely be ourselves. And then, of course, there are times when it all seems pretty darn close to being in balance. As I was getting ready to go to the Pride Parade this year, my little boy looked at me and said, “Happy Pride, Mama.” Wow, I thought, how wonderful and complicated this all is. Perhaps I can find a pocket of the world where all the pieces of myself co-exist in harmony. And perhaps it is true that you can give more to the people you love when being fully who you are.

This brings me to my second response: They are right. No matter how much I protest, the fact remains that I am different. I get it. And if the tables were turned, I would struggle with understanding someone who was making the choices I have made. It would seem sort of, well, half-assed. A kind of have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too life built on a desire for convenience and social conformity. While this judgment from my peers makes me feel like a seven-year-old girl standing alone at the edge of the playground, I appreciate the sacrifices and journey of these other women too much to fault them. It’s not as if I haven’t asked myself the very same questions. Am I taking the easy way out? Perhaps I am just the laziest lesbian on the planet, so wiped out I can’t even be bothered to divorce my husband. At the end of the day I have to come back to my perspective on my life, and the reality of my experience. I chose to stay with my husband because I love him, and he loves me. Enough love, I might add, to make room in our life and marriage for all of who I am. The work it takes to sustain that kind of relationship is not the easy way out. I’ve sewn my life together as it is because such is the authentic reflection of who I am. My choices raise questions about what marriage is, what it is based on, and how it survives. Does love trump orientation? Most days I’m pretty sure it does. Some days I don’t know. But either way, I believe in continuing to discover where love and a little honesty can take you.

Sexuality is an important part of who one is, and it can be unsettling to feel unresolved about it. But it shouldn’t matter; it’s only the perception of others that makes these decisions difficult. The biggest adjustment for me was the realization that if I weren’t straight, people around me would always demand an explanation; they would never allow me to be uncertain. It was only by shutting out their voices that I was able to find myself in a place beyond male and female, beyond gay and straight, beyond sexuality.

The past could turn you into a strip of paper with a single side, so that comfort and vulnerability slid away down invisible channels and couldn’t be grasped. Except, perhaps, if you bent your will towards unlearning your own history. If you let yourself soften and be porous. Even if only like this, in silence, and at an angle.

There are so many expectations that society places on heterosexual wives, including the one that requires a wife to surrender a large part of herself and sacrifice her dreams for the greater good of the marriage. That was the case in my marriage. My husband, who by and large is a good man, was raised in a very traditional home where his mother’s entire purpose in life was to cater to her husband and children. She was expected to put her needs and wants on the back burner, and her traditional Korean upbringing reinforced this belief.

There are so many expectations that society places on heterosexual wives, including the one that requires a wife to surrender a large part of herself and sacrifice her dreams for the greater good of the marriage. That was the case in my marriage. My husband, who by and large is a good man, was raised in a very traditional home where his mother’s entire purpose in life was to cater to her husband and children. She was expected to put her needs and wants on the back burner, and her traditional Korean upbringing reinforced this belief. I, on the other hand, was raised by a single mother who championed education, independence, and self-reliance. Culturally, as an African American, I was taught that my load would be heavier, but that I should have the fortitude to bear it. It’s interesting to note that while my mother stressed these attributes, she also strongly encouraged me to immerse myself in my marriage, and depend heavily on my husband for stability and support. My husband was stable, traditional, and faithful. I tried everything I could to be the kind of wife that he wanted—to be a suburban soccer mom (not even close to my personality), to be the supermom who handled the home (cleaning, shopping, bill paying, cooking), and a super stepmom to his daughter. I worked a full-time job while obtaining an advanced degree, wore Victoria’s Secret thongs and heels, and gave in to sex on demand. At the same time, I was exhausted, resentful, angry, and cold. I tried the “fake it till you make it” thing but I never quite got there. I seldom enjoyed sex because it seemed like one more thing I had to do. And that wasn’t my husband’s fault; it was mine. I rarely said no to anything or anyone. I was over-extended. I didn’t put my foot down and say, “Wait a minute--we are a partnership. Start acting like it!” I allowed things to continue like this until it was too late to salvage anything.

By that I do not mean that you are a better feminist if you are gay or bisexual, but that falling in love with a woman enables you to overcome, and perhaps heal from, some of the worst wounds of patriarchy. It challenges the voice that says women’s bodies are disgusting, the sexual persona that is passive or must be desired rather than desire, and provides an avenue to sexual pleasure for the body that has been exploited or violated. Falling in love with a woman can free you from the trap of reflected glory—if you once saw yourself as valuable because you landed a certain kind of man, this new state of affairs forces you to derive your sense of worth from yourself.
